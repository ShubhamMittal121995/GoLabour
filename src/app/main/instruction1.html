    The right of instruction is a central component of the employment relationship. The employer has a large latitude in issuing instructions and rules. But the limit lies in the personal right of the worker.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Right of Instruction of the Employer</strong> <br>The employer can carry out instructions on the execution of the work and behavior of the employees in the company (Art. 321d OR). The employee may provide different types of instructions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Work instructions regulate how employees need to work. This includes technical instructions such as which method and which machine you need to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Behavior instructions regulate working, safety and the appearance or the clothes of workers.
        </li>
        <li>
            General instructions may e.g. be a smoking ban, a secrecy or a duty of care.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Limits of the right of Instruction </strong>
    <br> The employee has to follow the instructions in good faith Art. 321d Abs. 2 OR). The boundary of the instruction right represents the right to privacy (Art. 328 OR). Statements that are illegal or immoral, must also not be followed as absurd or
    frivolous statements.
