    A typical labour mandi functions with two key players - the demand/consumer (employers seeking man-power) and the supply (man-power seeking deployment) and depends on each other to fulfill their respective requirements. However, lack of any proper communication
    channel between consumers and labourers is a major setback to the mandi dynamics. It is unfortunate that this highly potent sector is significantly ‘unorganized’ and remains marred with such a momentous issue and is scarcely surviving with a 2% annual
    growth. GoLabour , an innovation powered by Otaf Overseas Private Limited, tried to get a more comprehensive understanding of this dynamics and devised a unique digital formula steering the GPS based mobile phone design road map with an aim of helping
    generate and abridge leads of employment for the unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers in India.
    <br> We are sincerely committed to the ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’ initiatives by the Indian Government. Inspirited by these fundamental initiatives, GoLabour has launched a novel Mobile Optimized APP, that will enable direct communication between
    the consumer and the daily wage labourer, round the clock, i.e. free of the limitations of time and location.
    <br> We aim at resolving issues like communication-gap, unavailability and unreliability for the consumers while at the same time- increasing demand, hours, days and value of employability for the daily wage earners. We believe that technology will
    help make this unorganized sector reach its bona fide efficiency.
    <br> GoLabour is a proud recipient of the necessary incubation support from iCreate, an independent centre that works towards facilitating ‘Next Generation Entrepreneurship’ and engages with the government to help evolve enabling policies.
    <br> Currently, we are headquartered in Ahmedabad, Gujarat and working towards expanding our operations across India, Nepal, Africa, UAE and Bangladesh.
