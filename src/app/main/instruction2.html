    Although ISO 9001:2015 has relaxed the strict requirement for quality management documentation, in order to satisfy the remaining documentation requirements, and to properly implement the quality management system (QMS), ISO 9001 Processes, Procedures
    and Work Instructions are typically still employed. Unfortunately, within the QMS planning and documentation realm, the terms often confused. Below youâ€™ll find definitions of each of these terms with examples and links to resources to help you improve
    creation of your ISO 9001:2015 documentation.

    <strong>The Relationship Between Processes, Procedures and Work Instructions</strong><br> When a company documents its QMS, it is an effective practice to clearly and concisely identify their processes, procedures and work instructions in order to
    explain and control how it meets the requirements of ISO 9001:2015. This begins with a basic understanding of the hierarchy of these terms and how to efficiently categorize the workings of a management system within them. Simply put:
    <br> A <strong>process</strong> states what needs to be done and why<br> A <strong> states</strong> how the process needs to be done <br> A <strong>work</strong> instruction explains how to carry out the procedure. <br> Consider a process as a high
    level, strategic method of control, in effect a summary of objectives, specifications, and broad resources needed. The procedure adds more specifics such as responsibilities, specific tools, methods, and measurement. And a work instruction is a step-by-step
    guideline to implement the process and procedure, often segmented in some way to focus those who are doing the actual work.
